# SurreyPolice

This is my NEA project I did for AQA Computer Science. It's a database on Surrey Police (surprise surprise) which comes with
- Hashing
- Search
- Tree-eqsue functions
- SQL Functions
Ideally, run this on a database that supports Derby or something idk.

**TO THE BIG HEADS AT AQA**: If you find this, please remember that I am the ACTUAL OWNER of this program (save the Surrey Police logo which I use with free use w/o profit legal mumbo jumbo) and don't bother saying that this is plagarism because I made this over the course of 9 or so months. Let me be and do your boring paperwork stuff you have to do.
