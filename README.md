#### Now Reigate College approved! Thanks Julie 
This is my NEA project I did for AQA Computer Science. It's a database on Surrey Police (surprise surprise) which comes with
- Hashing
- Search
- Tree-eqsue functions
- SQL Functions

Ideally, run this on a database that supports Derby or something idk.

If you don't know what it is, it's a piece of coursework I did over June 2017 - March 2018 which went towards my A-Level. I made it with Netbeans using Derby and Java. SQL was used for the database functions (duh)

Public because I'm not at college anymore + results came in.

All the important "how do i get good markz" information is in **src/Database**. Look for the files ending in ".java". 

**TO THE BIG HEADS AT AQA**: If you find this, please remember that I am the ACTUAL OWNER of this program (save the Surrey Police logo which I use with free use w/o profit legal mumbo jumbo) and don't bother saying that this is plagarism because I made this over the course of 9 or so months. Let me be and do your boring paperwork stuff you have to do.

**TO ANY POTENTIAL STUDENTS WANTING TO DO THEIR NEA**: Look at the code! Literally search through it and see what data structures I've put in and see if you can **replicate, not steal** these in your work. This isn't a perfect example though, you can look at some sections of it I didn't do well in (i.e. the sort) and improve on that. If you get done for plagarism when your coursework gets sent to AQA, please don't cry to me saying that I've given you the code for free (you're the one stealing my code lololololololol)

I'd like to thank Julie Hodgson from Reigate College for allowing me to do this application
